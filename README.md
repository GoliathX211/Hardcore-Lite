# About

A mod that brings hardcore mode to multiplayer Necesse.

When a player dies on a server with death penalty set to Hardcore, their player save file will be deleted and the world will go on without them. Next time the player reconnects, they will have to create a new character just like when they first started.

The mod also makes sure that if the player was on a team before they died, they will still be on that team when they create a new character.

Similarly, if the player owned a team, they will continue to own that team when they recreate their character. This allows private settlements to continue operating for teams no matter who dies.
